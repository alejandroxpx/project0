Project 0 

My project contains 4 main sections hobbies, education, music and other. In each section I give a little bit of information about myself while accomplishing the requirements of this project. Each major section contains it's own html page and some of the files i have included are images that are contained within the html files. I also have a .scss and .css file for styling purposes. I had an issue with the published website when looking at Music.html, some of the images were not appearing but I believe it is fixed now.
